# Basketball-Connect-4

Course-long project for EECS 373, embedded systems and design. The purpose of this project is to utilize a Smartfusion FPGA with ARM cortex-M3 processor to control an arcade style game. The game is a scaled remake of the classic game connect four. Instead of dropping chips into the board, you instead throw a nerf basketball into a moving net mounted above the board. Whenever a basket is scored, individually addressable are lit up to demonstrate a chip dropping on the board. Players take turns throwing the ball and switch player with the press of a button. Scores are tracked on a VGA monitor interfaced directly with the FPGA through custom made libraries.
